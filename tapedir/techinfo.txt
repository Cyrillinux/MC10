Technical Information: MC-10 and Color Computer Cassette Routines

The Cassette Routines use the following memory locations

 ------- MC-10 -------  ------- Co-Co -------
  Address    Decimal     Address     Decimal  Name    Description

   421F                   009D                EXEADR  Default EXEC Address
   4256       16982       01D1         465    FNLEN   File Name Length
 4257-425E 16983-16990  01D2-01D9    466-473  FNAM    File Name Buffer
 425F-426D 16691-17005  01DA-02D9    474-729  CASBUF  Header/Data Buffer
   4275       17013       007C                BLKTYP  Block Type
   4276       17014       007D                BLKLEN  Block Length
 4278-4279 17016-17017  007E-007F             CBUFAD  Buffer Address

When writing blocks, the MC-10 and CoCo set Block Type to 0 for a Header 
block, 1 for a Data block, and $FF (255) for an End of File (EOF) block.

When reading blocks, the MC-10 recognize Block Type 0 as a Header block, 
1 - 127 as a Data block, and 128 - 255 as an EOF block. However, after
an EOF block is read the Error Flag is set to 255 - Block Type, so any
value other than 255 will register as an error.

The cassette header buffer is written to tape on a CSAVE or CSAVE*, and
read from tape on a CLOAD, CLOAD*, or CLOADM. While the MC-10 has a 
dedicated cassette header buffer, the CoCo uses the cassette data buffer:
The cassette header contains the following fields.

     ------- MC-10 -------  ------- Co-Co -------
 Ofs  Address    Decimal     Address     Decimal  Name    Description
  0  425F-4266    16991     01DA-01E1    474-481  FNAME   File Name 
  8    4267       16999       01E2         482    FTYPE   File Type 
  9    4268       17000       01E3         483    DTYPE   Data Type 
 10    4269       17001       01E4         484    GAPFLG  Gap Flag  
 11  426A-426B 17002-17003  01E5-01E6    485-486  XOFS    M/L EXEC Address
 13  426C-426D 17004-17005  01E7-01E8    487-488  LAL     M/L Load Address

During a cold start on both the MC-10 and CoCo, the cassette header or
data buffer is filled with the byte 0 (ASCII NUL).

When doing a CSAVE (or CSAVE* on the MC-10), both the MC-10 and CoCo pad 
FNAME with spaces, and set FTYPE and GAPFLG to 0. The MC-10 always sets 
DTYPE to 0, while the CoCo sets it to 0 for a regular CSAVE or 255 for 
CSAVE ,A. Neither the MC-10 or CoCo explicitly set XOFS. The MC-10 sets 
LAL to the length of data being written to the tape, but the CoCo does not 
explicitly set it.

During an OPEN "O",-1,... the CoCo pads FNAME with spaces, sets FTYPE to 1,
and both DTYPE and GAPFLG to 255. It does not explicitly set XOFS or LAL. 

When doing a CSAVEM, the CoCo pads FNAME with spaces, sets FTYPE to 3,
DTYPE and GAPFLG to 0, XOFS to the specified transfer address and LAL to 
the specified start address. This is the only Basic command that sets all
of the header fields.

For any field that is not explicitly set by a Basic command, whatever data
*happens to be in that field will be written to the tape header. 

When reading a header, the MC-10 checks compares FNAME against FNAM (if 
FNAM is populated) and verifies that FTYPE is 0 for CLOAD, 2 for CLOADM, 
or 4 for CLOAD*. The contents of DTYPE and GAPFLG are ignored. CLOADM 
adds the specified offset address (if any) to XOFS and LAL and stores
the results in EXEADR and CBUFAD, while CLOAD and CLOAD* ignore XOFS 
and issue an OM? error if the value in LAL exceeds the available Basic
program or array variable space, respectively.

The MC-10 expects File Type 0 for CLOAD, 2 for CLOADM, and 4 for CLOAD*,
otherwise it will issue an FM? (Bad File Mode) error. It ignores Data Type
and the Gap Flag, as all files are assumed to be binary and have no gaps
between blocks. CLOADM uses Exec Offset to set the EXEC command default 
address and Load Address to determine the start address of the loaded file,
while CLOAD and CLOADV ignore XOFS and use Load Address as the files length.
